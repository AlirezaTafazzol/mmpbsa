Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Oct 20 09:59:50 2010 -0500

    Enforced use of MMPBSA_FORMAT in EMap
    
    Updated SanderInterface::suspend_or_resume_threads for changes in
    the boinc library.

commit 364885695fe3313ee54afb37b331f75eb99ecaa0
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 15 16:02:29 2010 -0500

    Updated
    Updated EnergyInfo for varying amber energy label formats (e.g. 1-4
    van der waals energy)

commit 6b93f0941758f9dec7e4032f2dff74d16bca5801
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 11 14:33:29 2010 -0500

    Corrected EEL & HBOND energy term labels with >> and << operator
    overloads.

commit 2e65fb90524abbfed182aa81497c739ee930aa46
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 11 10:08:02 2010 -0500

    Added "moledyn" to the list of  recognized processes in getQueueFile

commit e84b5a47522e312cfc49c906142069eb9f79f3e6
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 8 13:43:02 2010 -0500

    Improved mmpbsa routine to better handle radii, including treating
    it as a float rather than mmpbsa_t (float is used by MEAD).

commit 1db010a362f6483bd7ab76a72bfd50fddb63b761
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Oct 6 13:53:47 2010 -0500

    Changed the include path for BOINC headers to use a lower case directory.

commit aec1bf354410787d3b2bf752b655fac020f6f419
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 1 09:55:54 2010 -0500

    Changed mmpbsa to use the "inpcrd" tag in the queue XML file as the
    input coordinate file for doing MMPBSA. Originally, mdcrd was used
    as this is, or can be, the file extension used for that file type.
    However, for better compatibility with sander command line arguments,
    inpcrd is being used instead.

commit 7f6e7e32e3ec6828230f3b61cac16201a2f6d54d
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 30 08:55:11 2010 -0500

    Fixed XMLParser::parse to read CR characters (and remove them).
    This will better facilitate capatibility between windows and linux.

commit c4a430bd2d2a65cbab5f359f2101256877f022fc
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 27 10:12:18 2010 -0500

    Corrected mismatch between header and source in mmpbsa_exceptions

commit 6362b94a4bbc2f49ae45f7cf867d3242ea1dc30c
Author: David Coss (macbook) <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Sep 24 16:02:52 2010 -0500

    REMOVED disable-molsurf from previous commit. It turns out that
    SA_ONESHOT can be replaced by SA_RESETHAND, which OSX does have.
    This is preferred since it allows molsurf to run on the mac.
    
    Fixed bug in mmpbsa restart. Removed redundant "snapCounter" from
    mmpbsa_run, which was already contained in currState.currentSnap.

commit 77fc08108b63c8170fddd702088ff8bcb9b12c55
Author: David Coss (macbook) <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Sep 24 13:20:24 2010 -0500

    Added a ./configure flag "--disable-molsurf" that will define
    WITHOUT_MOLSURF. If WITHOUT_MOLSURF is defined, none of the molsurf
    code is compiled and MeadInterface sets the surface area equal to zero.
    This was prompted by a lack of signal code in OSX needed for the
    jumpy nature of molsurf. If molsurf is replaced by good code, this
    will no longer be necessary.

commit 9e00f59dc9b5d20ae151d8b34416e21e5b01f967
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 23 10:57:16 2010 -0500

    Fix bug with the "--version" argument that allowed the program to
    continue after printing the version.

commit 0fd1b32fc51f831317199dbadb89501c8d0fca56
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 20 15:41:12 2010 -0500

    Removed unnecessary MEAD reference in mmpbsa_utils. This requirement
    is not needed for the functions in mmpbsa_utils and was causing an
    unnecessary requirement for grid_tools. Ideally, all of the mead
    includes should be in the MeadInterface abstraction layer.

commit 7ad0ef80b0bfa03929b7bf40b3700cecc4db2e63
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 20 14:20:39 2010 -0500

    Added molsurf headers to the include list to be copied when
    "make install" is run.

commit dc9944e0982ddb2daafe1b7b2f0167aebede70e7
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 20 14:14:00 2010 -0500

    Added the compiler flag "-Wall" to automake. Then corrected warnings.

commit 6e27ab22d479e7060d4109bbad28ec4248eb76ab
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Tue Sep 14 10:29:45 2010 -0500

    I switched to not using "__" in my #defines (e.g. USE_BOINC), because
    I think this should be reserved for compiler defines (e.g. __cplusplus)

commit 604aeb7d28b13a51bcbd578893e3e549c4087e77
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 2 08:51:18 2010 -0500

    Fixed constructor and sqrt problems with EnergyInfo.

commit 49370896f398d494bad6798539685102066c0fd2
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Sep 1 16:08:38 2010 -0500

    Added features to EnergyInfo to make it more user friendly with
    validation in grid_tools. Also, EnergyInfo now extends valarray
    rather than containing it.
    
    Add the ability for MMPBSAException (and extensions) to be written
    directly to an ostream so that one can do something like:
    
    std::cout << execObj << std::endl;

commit 63a27e52d30442036a7c703307b436670e8d3fd7
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 31 16:20:48 2010 -0500

    The 'const XMLNode* const getHead()const' function was accidentally
    removed, but this is needed for constant references to XMLParser.
    This has been fixed.

commit 34c29c63a1666e300af1837571e6ee5e1413abda
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 30 16:18:24 2010 -0500

    Made mmpbsa_run append energy data rather then overwrite. Also,
    energy data is written after each snapshot; thus no energy data
    is lost if the program is restarted.
    
    XMLParser has looser restrictions on access to its head node, making
    it easier to use as a convenient wrapper for the XMLNode

commit 02e93552362fa22175c0752d2e740b4804dc7436
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 27 16:21:45 2010 -0500

    More improvement for grid_tools.

commit 0bd6267d7d8fed6afb03c7d5ef07a3b4fb65181c
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 27 08:52:56 2010 -0500

    Made improvements to the library for its use with grid_tools.

commit 1f87db449b8f9bc6269998cd28d926c97de4b354
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 24 10:55:23 2010 -0500

    "Audited" for security problems, as grid time is approaching.
    This generally means using stringstreams instead of scanf and
    printf. There are couple of exceptions, but strict sanity checking
    is used.

commit d7b8b5aaed364d8439f87fbc71213af35a3c38f7
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 23 14:44:37 2010 -0500

    Added <?xml...?> to be ignored by XMLParser.

commit c96b5ff9c5bfa68c376ba14912382ed3ddf07b7f
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 23 13:25:02 2010 -0500

    Removed GPL notice from StringTokenizer. Again, blame sander.

commit 64552b10b6c2e2dcd17b1b3ffce6f1f65cd3353a
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 20 15:36:22 2010 -0500

    Removed default GPL license. :-(  Blame sander.

commit 6ba9dd63501ab88cf6472c656ea9b36165ba65f5
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 20 12:02:51 2010 -0500

    Added functions to EMap and XMLNode/Parser to improve data
    validation.

commit 03568f38dce4ce5f7d703c92b793890c012c2ded
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Thu Aug 19 14:27:30 2010 -0500

    Moved mmpbsa::Emap code to its own set of cpp/h files after adding
    more operator overloads to be used in data validation.

commit 472c77d09330e5b95245f87322a549bccae4df64
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 18 12:27:11 2010 -0500

    Changed the output of the mmpbsa energy date to be in XML format.
    This will make validation on the grid smoother. Something similar
    might need to be done with sander too.

commit a58b8d11264e72d915fe8ea4d6575fe2e719a27c
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 16 15:45:11 2010 -0500

    Updated the files for the necessary graphics objects and functions
    for windows. The configure.ac file now assumes you are building
    in windows. As UC Berkeley has yet to make a BOINC screensaver for
    linux, this is not a problem.

commit 48022c2ebf2267cae6886e1572106cff744aae30
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 16 12:28:00 2010 -0500

    Added mmpbsa_gutil to attempt to break the dependency on jpeglib,
    unless specifically requested.

commit 39c6bde3baf0ed1cd21277646fddf1bfc3c5b431
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 16 09:02:17 2010 -0500

    Changed #include's to place BOINC header files in a "BOINC/" path.
    The reason for this 1.) the BOINC "make install" does this and 2.)
    it organizes headers better.

commit c5dea2e8ac6d7af041bde71c2f06d8f32fb3d680
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 13 16:07:42 2010 -0500

    Added documentation for XMLParser/Node and cleaned up boinc include structure.

commit 42ebf5333b37e5f6706be59ed53357618a175d22
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 13 14:25:22 2010 -0500

    Moved away from the dependency on libxml2. This was a tremendous
    pain in windows. At the same time, only a very small portion
    of the whole library was being used. Therefore, a new independent
    XML Parser was made for libmmpbsa.

Date:   Fri Aug 13 08:28:56 2010 -0500

    Updated information files (ie INSTALL) in light of the addition
    of boinc and sander.
    
    Added patch file to modify sander for the use with SanderInterface.

Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 9 15:18:54 2010 -0500

    Added a flag to configure ("--enable-static") that will compile
    MMPBSA statically.

commit 97a57cac152ebfe16ffebfa23c28410ca5c4b665

    Forgot the graphics files...

commit 08e8801ff2b3a169549e8b9bab8fe5bb6bf06746
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 6 15:35:05 2010 -0500

    Integrated Graphics into MMPBSA/MD. Requires BOINC. Currently, the
    graphics app displays a the CPU time elapsed by the program and the
    overall progress. Also, a representation of Alanine bounces around
    the screen. This is create based on coordinates in a float array;
    therefore, other molecules can be quickly created. The molecule can
    be rotated and zoomed using the left and right mouse buttons,
    respectively.

commit 24f4e237fdd784340c26ec3ef9ac4c09dfb90b44
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 6 07:58:55 2010 -0500

    Fixed boinc suspsend/restart problem.

commit 0dfca1c4e388d783386ae5dc5b759b3dfc8e3807
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 4 11:45:51 2010 -0500

    Added a sample queue which may be created as via a command line
    argument. Tested (with success) the program in a BOINC client.
    Both MD and MMPBSA will run in the boinc client. Progress is
    reported well by the client.
    
    Now that MMPBSA & MD work with BOINC, the compilation requirement of
    BOINC has been removed. MMPBSA can be used with or without BOINC.

commit f8bd9a0477009b3824c7285a9ba4a0fc4cb9fced
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 2 16:15:53 2010 -0500

    Incorportated MD into MMPBSA, via Sander. Progress is relayed to
    the BOINC client and the client can control Sander using this
    program as an intermediary. An XML based queue has been made to
    allow the user to explicitly layout the order of the simulations
    to be performed. TODO: Add a sample queue file.

commit 947e4ad895a2930d2ceddb5a5fab8bfaa9498714
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 2 11:32:00 2010 -0500

    MMPBSA can now do MD, MMPBSA or both. This commit is to save that
    stage before better organizing the procedure.

Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 30 11:54:59 2010 -0500

    Tested the integration of sander. Minimization was sucessfully done on polyAT.

commit 5f43da7ef5d326188dd2e069b18c5ac9bb9fd6e6
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 29 15:53:37 2010 -0500

    Removed Makefile.mmpbsa since it is unnecessary after using automake
    
    Started the integration of Sander into MMPBSA. Right now it forks and
    controls sander as its own process. BOINC functions remain in MMPBSA,
    which will handle reporting sander's progress, as well as controlling
    sander based on the client's wishes. This commit marks the prototype
    of this integration. Testing and refinement are needed.

commit 4d493ead14a8401bca7ef7007d694ea645e59a9b
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 28 12:30:28 2010 -0500

    Added files needed by make that were left out of the previous commit.

commit 7d9a62f2fe09e7f0b66a2f60f5de1bd80b4a5399
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 28 12:11:02 2010 -0500

    Added BOINC tags to configure.ac and Makefile.am
    
    Removed freeMemory() from EmpEnerFun. The restructoring previously done to EmpEnerFun (git commit 9f1275cd773843a1d872e925cafe43a48672d4e6) made this unnecessary.

commit 53f11148c0799ebfd792d950b02f9b3a7fc8dda5
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 28 09:44:44 2010 -0500

    Restructored the library, placing everything not centered around
    the main() function in mmpbsa.cpp, in the "mmpbsa" namespace.
    Also SanderParm was placed in its own c++ file. Both of these
    choices are based on using mmpbsa as a library with other programs
    which will be developed later.

commit c56f449e549f4fa3cdda1933fcfcdc2d895941ec
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Tue Jul 27 14:48:15 2010 -0500

    Renamed Energy.* to EmpEnerFun.*
    	There may be more pure energy classes later with MD calculations.
    	Therefore, I may not want to call this Energy.

    Setup MMPBSA to use autotools. As the project has grown, making a Makefile
    has likewise become complex. Therefore using autotools is a natural choice.
    As a result, the directory try has been restructured as well.

    Updated Makefile for XMLParser

commit 466b3260e7de5498288b344c6e595c9660806ebc
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 26 10:41:26 2010 -0500

    Added checkpointing, saving the state in an XML file. BOINC checkpointing
    functions are included, but are only used if the "__USE_BOINC__"
    preprocessor flag is set at compile time.
    
    XML file reading and writing is done with XMLParser, which is a wrapper for libxml2. Therefore, MMPBSA requires the libxml2 library, which is freely available and standard in linux.

    Separated Complex, Receptor and Ligand outputting. Doing so may help monitor and pause the application better (thinking ahead to the grid).

    Added command line parameter "snap_list" that will allow the use to calculate specific
    snapshot energies. This is a good idea for parallel computing, since it will
    allow one to calculate different snapshots on different nodes.

    Moved main.cpp to mmpbsa.cpp. Might make other "main" classes. In which case, main.cpp will no longer make sense.

    Made command line use more natural. All that is left in that respect is creating a list of which molecules belong to the receptor and which belong to the ligand. The implementation of this will depend in part on how it will be used later, .e. should it be a csv list.

    Updated gnu make file. Added a better handler for EOF of trajectory file
    in main.cpp, adding an UNEXPECTED_EOF error type.

    Finished the EmpEnerFun Loading process. Test loaded an energy function with a solvent. Still need to test without a solvent to see if BondWalker works correctly.
    
    Added Makefile.mmpbsa which can be used with gnu compiler and make.

    Added mmpbsa_utils, which is a namespace that holds various utility functions that are needed in the other classes.
    Created an mmpbsa_t type using typedef. This was done so that precision, i.e. float versus double, may be adjusted.

    All of the SanderIO function is included in the combination of SanderIO and EnergyInfo. I separated out the energy specific information into a separate class. Now there exists classes for parameters and energy information, with the latter in EnergyInfo.
    
    Added StringTokenizer. With all of the file parsing that is needed to load data,this class became quite necessary. Borrowed this class from my own previous applications.

    SanderIO compiles, runs and correctly reads a file.
    Added a doxygen file to produce documentation.
    Separated out the SanderIOException class from SanderIO, creating a general
    	mmpbsa exception class. In this header, there are globally scoped
    	error types. These can be references for debugging purposes.
