Latest Change:
Integrated Graphics into MMPBSA/MD. Requires BOINC. Currently, the graphics app displays a the CPU time elapsed by the program and the overall progress. Also, a representation of Alanine bounces around the screen. This is create based on coordinates in a float array; there other molecules can be quickly created. The molecule can be rotated and zoomed using the left and right mouse buttons, respectively.

Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 6 07:58:55 2010 -0500

    Fixed boinc suspsend/restart problem.

commit 0dfca1c4e388d783386ae5dc5b759b3dfc8e3807
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 4 11:45:51 2010 -0500

    Added a sample queue which may be created as via a command line
    argument. Tested (with success) the program in a BOINC client.
    Both MD and MMPBSA will run in the boinc client. Progress is
    reported well by the client.
    
    Now that MMPBSA & MD work with BOINC, the compilation requirement of
    BOINC has been removed. MMPBSA can be used with or without BOINC.

commit f8bd9a0477009b3824c7285a9ba4a0fc4cb9fced
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 2 16:15:53 2010 -0500

    Incorportated MD into MMPBSA, via Sander. Progress is relayed to
    the BOINC client and the client can control Sander using this
    program as an intermediary. An XML based queue has been made to
    allow the user to explicitly layout the order of the simulations
    to be performed. TODO: Add a sample queue file.

Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 2 11:32:00 2010 -0500

    MMPBSA can now do MD, MMPBSA or both. This commit is to save that
    stage before better organizing the procedure.

    Tested the integration of sander. Minimization was sucessfully done on polyAT.

Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 29 15:53:37 2010 -0500

    Removed Makefile.mmpbsa since it is unnecessary after using automake
    
    Started the integration of Sander into MMPBSA. Right now it forks and
    controls sander as its own process. BOINC functions remain in MMPBSA,
    which will handle reporting sander's progress, as well as controlling
    sander based on the client's wishes. This commit marks the prototype
    of this integration. Testing and refinement are needed.

    Added files needed by make that were left out of the previous commit.

Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 28 12:11:02 2010 -0500

    Added BOINC tags to configure.ac and Makefile.am
    
    Removed freeMemory() from EmpEnerFun. The restructoring previously done to EmpEnerFun (git commit 9f1275cd773843a1d872e925cafe43a48672d4e6) made this unnecessary.

Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 28 09:44:44 2010 -0500

    Restructored the library, placing everything not centered around
    the main() function in mmpbsa.cpp, in the "mmpbsa" namespace.
    Also SanderParm was placed in its own c++ file. Both of these
    choices are based on using mmpbsa as a library with other programs
    which will be developed later.

    Renamed Energy.* to EmpEnerFun.*
    	There may be more pure energy classes later with MD calculations.
    	Therefore, I may not want to call this Energy.

    Setup MMPBSA to use autotools. As the project has grown, making a Makefile
    has likewise become complex. Therefore using autotools is a natural choice.
    As a result, the directory try has been restructured as well.

    Updated Makefile for XMLParser

commit 466b3260e7de5498288b344c6e595c9660806ebc
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 26 10:41:26 2010 -0500

    Added checkpointing, saving the state in an XML file. BOINC checkpointing
    functions are included, but are only used if the "__USE_BOINC__"
    preprocessor flag is set at compile time.
    
    XML file reading and writing is done with XMLParser, which is a wrapper for libxml2. Therefore, MMPBSA requires the libxml2 library, which is freely available and standard in linux.

    Separated Complex, Receptor and Ligand outputting. Doing so may help monitor and pause the application better (thinking ahead to the grid).

Date:   Tue Jul 20 16:06:16 2010 -0500

    Added command line parameter "snap_list" that will allow the use to calculate specific
    snapshot energies. This is a good idea for parallel computing, since it will
    allow one to calculate different snapshots on different nodes.

    Moved main.cpp to mmpbsa.cpp. Might make other "main" classes. In which case, main.cpp will no longer make sense.

    Made command line use more natural. All that is left in that respect is creating a list of which molecules belong to the receptor and which belong to the ligand. The implementation of this will depend in part on how it will be used later, .e. should it be a csv list.

    Updated gnu make file. Added a better handler for EOF of trajectory file
    in main.cpp, adding an UNEXPECTED_EOF error type.

    Successfully added (and tested) adding MEAD's PB solver. All that remains for mmpbsa calculations is SA calculation.

    Finished the EmpEnerFun Loading process. Test loaded an energy function with a solvent. Still need to test without a solvent to see if BondWalker works correctly.
    
    Added Makefile.mmpbsa which can be used with gnu compiler and make.

    Added mmpbsa_utils, which is a namespace that holds various utility functions that are needed in the other classes.
    Created an mmpbsa_t type using typedef. This was done so that precision, i.e. float versus double, may be adjusted.

Date:   Tue Jun 22 11:41:26 2010 -0500

    All of the SanderIO function is included in the combination of SanderIO and EnergyInfo. I separated out the energy specific information into a separate class. Now there exists classes for parameters and energy information, with the latter in EnergyInfo.
    
    Added StringTokenizer. With all of the file parsing that is needed to load data,this class became quite necessary. Borrowed this class from my own previous applications.

    SanderIO compiles, runs and correctly reads a file.
    Added a doxygen file to produce documentation.
    Separated out the SanderIOException class from SanderIO, creating a general
    	mmpbsa exception class. In this header, there are globally scoped
    	error types. These can be references for debugging purposes.
