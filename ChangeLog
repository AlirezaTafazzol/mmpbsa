Latest change: 
Restructored the library, placing everything not centered around the main() function in mmpbsa.cpp, in the "mmpbsa" namespace. Also SanderParm was placed in its own c++ file. Both of these choices are based on using mmpbsa as a library with other programs which will be developed later.

    Renamed Energy.* to EmpEnerFun.*
    	There may be more pure energy classes later with MD calculations.
    	Therefore, I may not want to call this Energy.

    Setup MMPBSA to use autotools. As the project has grown, making a Makefile
    has likewise become complex. Therefore using autotools is a natural choice.
    As a result, the directory try has been restructured as well.

    Updated Makefile for XMLParser

commit 466b3260e7de5498288b344c6e595c9660806ebc
Author: David Coss <David.Coss@stjude.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 26 10:41:26 2010 -0500

    Added checkpointing, saving the state in an XML file. BOINC checkpointing
    functions are included, but are only used if the "__USE_BOINC__"
    preprocessor flag is set at compile time.
    
    XML file reading and writing is done with XMLParser, which is a wrapper for libxml2. Therefore, MMPBSA requires the libxml2 library, which is freely available and standard in linux.

    Separated Complex, Receptor and Ligand outputting. Doing so may help monitor and pause the application better (thinking ahead to the grid).

    Added command line parameter "snap_list" that will allow the use to calculate specific
    snapshot energies. This is a good idea for parallel computing, since it will
    allow one to calculate different snapshots on different nodes.

    Moved main.cpp to mmpbsa.cpp. Might make other "main" classes. In which case, main.cpp will no longer make sense.

    Made command line use more natural. All that is left in that respect is creating a list of which molecules belong to the receptor and which belong to the ligand. The implementation of this will depend in part on how it will be used later, .e. should it be a csv list.

    in main.cpp, adding an UNEXPECTED_EOF error type.

    Finished the EmpEnerFun Loading process. Test loaded an energy function with a solvent. Still need to test without a solvent to see if BondWalker works correctly.
    
    Added Makefile.mmpbsa which can be used with gnu compiler and make.

    Added mmpbsa_utils, which is a namespace that holds various utility functions that are needed in the other classes.
    Created an mmpbsa_t type using typedef. This was done so that precision, i.e. float versus double, may be adjusted.

    All of the SanderIO function is included in the combination of SanderIO and EnergyInfo. I separated out the energy specific information into a separate class. Now there exists classes for parameters and energy information, with the latter in EnergyInfo.
    
    Added StringTokenizer. With all of the file parsing that is needed to load data,this class became quite necessary. Borrowed this class from my own previous applications.

    SanderIO compiles, runs and correctly reads a file.
    Added a doxygen file to produce documentation.
    Separated out the SanderIOException class from SanderIO, creating a general
    	mmpbsa exception class. In this header, there are globally scoped
    	error types. These can be references for debugging purposes.
